## Introduction
The **Pharmacy Management System** is a Java-based application that facilitates online medicine ordering and remote doctor consultations. This system also maintains a record of all medicines ordered online. Users can access these services by signing up with a registered email ID, providing a convenient alternative to in-person consultations.

## Objective and Purpose
The primary objective of the Pharmacy Management System is to enhance patient care by managing orders, tracking prescriptions, and enabling remote doctor consultations. The purpose is to improve efficiency, accuracy, and safety in the pharmacy management process.

## Existing System
In the existing pharmacy management system, individuals have limited options for consulting doctorsâ€”either in-person or through voice calls. This system is time-consuming and may not be suitable for everyone, especially those who are unable to visit doctors directly.

## Drawbacks of Existing System
- **Time-Consuming Process:** Traditional methods are inefficient and time-consuming.
- **Limited Accessibility:** Not suitable for individuals unable to consult doctors directly.
- **Medicine Availability:** Challenges in obtaining prescribed medicines locally.

## Need for New System
The Pharmacy Management System addresses the drawbacks of the existing system by introducing an innovative online platform. This platform allows users to seamlessly order medicines online and consult doctors remotely, providing a more accessible and efficient healthcare solution.

## Proposed System
The proposed system is a web-based application developed using the Java programming language. It features a user-friendly interface for ordering medicines, tracking prescriptions, and engaging in remote consultations. The system aims to streamline the pharmacy management process, improve communication between healthcare providers and patients, and ensure the timely availability of prescribed medicines.

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** The application is built using the Java programming language, ensuring reliability and robustness.

## Minimum System Requirements
### Software Requirements:
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Required for running Java applications.
- **Web Browser:** Compatible web browser for accessing the web-based interface.

### Hardware Requirements:
- **Minimum 2GB RAM:** To ensure smooth performance.
- **Minimum 1GHz Processor:** Adequate processing power for efficient system operation.
